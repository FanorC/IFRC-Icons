# UNOCHA SVG Icons
### This version produced for use at the [IFRC](http://www.ifrc.org/)

## Purpose
 * UN created a standard set of humanitarian icons for use in humanitarian information products
 * Icons were created in PDF and Adobe Illustrator format
 * However, use of icons in SVG format for online products was previously difficult
 * Created these SVG icons and hosted them publically here on Github so that my team (and others) can use them for online information management products

## How to Roll Your Own
The colour codes in each svg file is in HEX format, making it easy to use another colour by simply find-and-replace the original colour with your own (e.g. either from black, #000000, or from IFRC Red, #EE3224, to your own).
